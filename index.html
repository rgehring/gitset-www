          <p> GitSET was one of the first recruiting agencies to use code analytics at scale for targeted recruiting.  </p>
          <h3>
            <a id="why-shut-down" class="anchor" href="#why-shut-down" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why shut down?
          </h3>

          <p> GitSET was able to reach profitability, however the business model of cold outreach to engineers wasn't a big change from the status quo. We were a classic case of
          solving the wrong problem---while GitSET was able to discover great engineers, we weren't any more effective than traditional recruiters at getting them to answer our emails. 
         Both founders chose to exit the business once it became clear we had essentially built a traditional recruiting shop using a different data source. </p>
